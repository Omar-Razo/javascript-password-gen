# Module Three Challenge: Javascript Password Generator

## Description

Given some starter code, we must create the logic for a password generator using Javascript. Given that this week was dedicated to learning and familiarizing ourselves with Javscript and its function, no editing was done to the HTML or CSS or required.

Taking the requirements for the password generator in mind, my approach focused on error handling (particularly incorrect input) and allowing the generator to dynamically build the password given varying user selection of password criteria.

Only issue of note was validating initial input (password length in particular). MDN web docs was consulted (see Credits).


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the requirements given to us for the password generator logic:

```
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password

WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```
